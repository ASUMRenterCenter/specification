# Human Services Data Specification

This specification defines a minimum set of data elements for a human services data specification. The idea behind the data specification is to create data sets that can be used by multiple domains of expertise. The goal is to derive a specification robust enough to support Information and Retrieval (IR) applications and flexible enough to support localized directories. The focus of this specification is content but a large portion of the specification is dedicated to format because reducing complex data structures into a commonly used format such as comma delimited files (CSV) requires decomposing them into separate files.

# Term Definitions

* Field required - The field column must be included in your feed, and a value must be provided for each record. Some required fields permit an empty string as a value. To enter an empty string, just omit any text between the commas for that field. Note that 0 is interpreted as "a string of value 0", and is not an empty string. Please see the field definition for details.

* Field optional - The field column may be omitted from your feed. If you choose to include an optional column, each record in your feed must have a value for that column. You may include an empty string as a value for records that do not have values for the column. Some optional fields permit an empty string as a value. To enter an empty string, just omit any text between the commas for that field. Note that 0 is interpreted as "a string of value 0", and is not an empty string.

# Conventions

This specification uses snake case where compound words are joined by an underscore. Field names are all lower case and in snake case, e.g. `organization_id`.


# Data Format

The data format is [JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation](http://json.org). JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent. Learn more at [JSON.org](http://json.org) or [Wikipedia/JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).


# Data Model

The basic entities are an organization or agency, a location or site, and a service or program. 
The structure is hierarchical in that an organization has one or more locations that provide one or more services.

The data model can be expressed as JSON. Below is an example JSON object that represents one organization, along with all 
of its locations, and all the services for each location.

The lowest common denominator for data exchange is the comma delimited text file or CSV. CSV are simple table structures. In order to represent complex data types such as arrays and objects, they need to be decomposed into individual tables that are joined to parent tables via a foreign key. The entity relationship diagram below shows how the CSV files are joined to form a single organization.

# Files

The following table list the files that are part of the Human Services Data Specification.


| File  | Required | Defines |
|:------|:---------:|:--------|
| organizations.csv | required | Organization that provides human services. |
| locations.csv | required | Locations that provide human services. |
| services.csv | required | Services provided at a location. |
| addresses.csv | required | location addresses |

## File Requirements

This section defines the format and contents of files.

* Data is saved in a comma-delimited file, string elements must be enclosed by double quotes
* The first line of each file must contain field names. Each subsection of the Field Definitions section corresponds to one of the files and lists the field names you may use in that file.
* Field names are case sensitive
* Field values may not contain tabs, carriage returns or new lines
*Field values that contain quotation marks or commas must be enclosed within quotation marks. In addition, each quotation mark in the field value must be preceded with a quotation mark. This is consistent with the manner in which Microsoft Excel outputs comma-delimited (CSV) files. For more information on the CSV file format, see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180.
	* The following example demonstrates how a field value would appear in a comma-delimited file:
	* Original field value: Contains "quotes", commas and text
	* Field value in CSV file: "Contains ""quotes"", commas and text"
* Field values must not contain HTML tags, comments or escape sequences.
* Remove any extra spaces between fields or field names.
* Each line must end with a CRLF or LF linebreak character.
* Files should be encoded in UTF-8 to support all Unicode characters.

## Field Definitions
Mapping JSON objects to a flat file format requires normalization of data. This means breaking up objects and arrays into individual tables and adding keys to enable joining them in either a JSON object or in a relational database.

# Extension

The specification can be extended or modified with additional data elements. If the data type is simple it can be directly added to the organizations, locations and services table definitions. If the data type is complex, e.g. an array or an object, then an additional CSV file will be necessary. Foreign key should be assigned as needed with the intended purpose of the data.
