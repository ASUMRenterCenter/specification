The Open Referral Initiative develops data standards and open platforms that make it easy to share and find information about community resources. Learn more about the initiative at [OpenReferral.org](http://www.openreferral.org).

## Data Specifications

This site contains documentation for the [Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)](hsds) and the [associated API Suite (HSDA)](hsda). 

These can be used to structure and exchange information about the accessibility of health, human, and social services. Specifically, they are used to describe the management of information about organizations, the services they provide, and the locations at which they can be accessed, along with associated details. 

## Our ecosystem

**Open Referralâ€™s ecosystem** includes a range of working open source software applications that can be freely redeployed to work with HSDS-compatible data and/or HSDA-compatible APIs. Many of these tools can be found in [our Github organization page](http://github.com/openreferral).
