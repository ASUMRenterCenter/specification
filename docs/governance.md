Specification Governance
========================

To promote participation and accessibility, this site serves as the working draft of the next version of Human Services Data Specification.

You can contribute to the development of the specification in two ways:

* **Adding annotations to this documentation site using hypothes.is** - just highlight any text, and then use the pop-up box to add your comments. You will need to sign-up for a free account with hypothes.is

* Adding or [engaging with issues on GitHub](https://github.com/openreferral/specification/issues/). We use this issue tracker to schedule all formal updates to the specification. Anyone can view and search the issues already raised. You will need to sign-up for a free GitHub account to comment or create issues.

There is also a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openreferral)where discussions around the specification are encouraged
