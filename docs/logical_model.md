Logical Model
=============

There are three key concepts in HSDS:

1. **Services** - which may have descriptions, contact details, opening times, target groups, eligibility requirements, accessibility information, and other important facts about them published so that people are able to identify and access services that can meet their needs. 
2. **Organisations** - who provide those services.
3. **Locations** - where those services are delivered - either physically, or virtually (over the phone or Internet).

In addition, HSDS can be used to capture extra information about the **programs** that organisations use to organise and fund collections of services.
